# Placement Portal

A web-based **Placement Management System** built using **Flask, SQLite, and Bootstrap**.  
The portal allows **students, companies, and administrators** to interact in a centralized system for managing placement drives and job applications.

This project simulates a real-world **college placement portal** where companies post opportunities, students apply, and the admin manages approvals.
